# Arduino_ZModem
Arduino SDCard file manager sketch with ZModem - see Wiki for more details

This repo has been modified by Eric Bateman for use with MIDI Router (https://github.com/insolace/MIDI-Router).  The internal SD card can be removed and accessed directly, but that can be cumbersome.  Load this sketch into MIDI Router and load a serial terminal program to browse the SD card and upload/download files with the Zmodem protocol.
